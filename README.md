# Android Project 3 - *Flixter*

Submitted by: **Gabriel Castejon**

**Flixter** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse movies currently playing in theaters.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [X] **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [ ] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [ ] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading
  - Note: this feature is difficult to capture in a GIF without throttling internet speeds.  Instead, include an additional screencap of your Glide code implementing the feature.  (<10 lines of code)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

*the walkthrough does not include the "request" aspect of the app because it is taking my emulator upwards of 5 minutes for it to load the data

## Notes

It was really difficult getting the API stuff to work, once I got it to work, the data would load in
very slowly, as such, I was not able to debug the title / description not working properly in time.
I will resubmit the project once these are fixed, but I got the main stuff to work.
